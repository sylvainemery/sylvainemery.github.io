It all started with the most epic presentation ever:

I was fortunate to be able to watch it live. It still gives me the goosebumps when I watch it again almost 2 years later...

As some of you know, I now own a Google Glass (by the way, please don't say "glasses", there is only one glass).
It is not easy to get Glass in France because Google sells it sparingly, and in the US only, so the mix of being a gadget-loving-geek and the scarcity of this particular gadget gets me really excited.

Being a so-called "Explorer", I chose to wear it all day, every day.
Some of you have already encountered me in the corridors or in meetings. I wear it also outside, in the streets, in the subway, in shops. Basically, if I'm awake, I wear Glass.
I have seen different reactions:
- some laugh at me, thinking I'm ridiculous with such a big frame on the side and no glass at all, besides the big block in front of my left eye
- some stare at me, not knowing what it is
- some are more curious and ask me to try it
Can you think of another device that can spark such a variety of reactions, from defiant to enthousiastic? How cool is that?


What Glass can't do?
- They can't record everything you do continuously. The battery is just not capable of it.
- They can't do facial recognition. Google forbids this kind of app. Of course, there will be unofficial apps that will do it anyways. But just like not everybody roots their phones, you can be sure that a very few people will agree to void the warranty of their precious Glass to recognize people on the fly. It's not just worth it.
- I can't see you naked through it. Just like there is no such thing as a "naked scanner" you can download for 1€ on your phone. Guys, seriously!

So, what can you do with Glass?
Glass is not always on. You have to activate it to see something on the screen. To do this, you just tap on the side, or turn your head up.
You then see a screen showing the time. There you can either navigate on your timeline and see what you have done with Glass in the past, or you can speak an order. Yes, Glass is able to do voice recognition (english only for the moment). So you can say "take a picture" and voilà, it just took a picture of what you're looking at. You can do a google search, and the most relevant result will printed on the screen AND spoken in your ear.
Here is an incomplete list of what you can do:
- take a picture, in a fraction of time you would need to do it with your smartphone.
- record a video. In my personal experience, you could shoot about 20 minutes of video before the battery runs out.
- search via Google. Just speak what you are looking for and a nice female voice will speak you the answer. It tends to give a wikipedia abstract often.
- make a phone call. Glass is connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth, so it becomes a hands-free headset. You can initiate or answer a call from Glass, no need to take your phone out of your pocket. And you can see who is calling, of course.
- send a message (hangout, SMS, tweet, Facebook status). Voice recognition again, so english only, but it works well.
- receive notifications of a new email, SMS, tweet or Facebook message.
- get directions via the GPS you have in your phone. Speak a destination and the step-by-step directions are shown on the screen. Battery killer of course.
- listen to music. You have to have a Google Play Music account and you hear it on the right ear only. Not the best experience.
- translate text. One of the apps that really impressed me is World Lens[http://questvisual.com/]. It replaces a text with its translation *in place*. Really cool wow effect when demoing. (it also exists on iOS and Android)

My personal use so far
