This blog and this post are long overdue. I thought about starting blogging several times in the past ten years. And the time is now.

## Why now

I've bought a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) when it was announced. Like many of my other geeky stuff, I've turned it on for a day or two, and then it has collected dust in a drawer.

But one day, I wanted to hack on a particular project. Because it's easily portable and doesn't draw too much electricity, my raspi was a great platform to build on.
(if you're curious about what this project, it's an [iBeacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon) and will soon be described on this blog)

Since this first project, I've found other stuff to hack about, regarding one of my hobbies: home automation.

## Home automation

This domain has changed a lot these past years, largely due to the opening of communication protocols ([X10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X10_\(industry_standard\)), [Z-Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave), [433MHz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPD433)) and the emergence of small hacking platforms like the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/), the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and the [Beagle Board](http://beagleboard.org/).

Being able to watch and control parts of your house is now at your fingertips -- literally, with a smartphone.

This is mainly what I'll be writing about: my attempts to know better and manage my home from afar.


## About that name

Er, "hack and cheese", srsly ?

I could tell you that I love to hack and I love cheese. It's true. But no. I just love [cheesy puns](http://www.pinterest.com/bookworm987/cheesy-jokes-and-puns/).
