This blog and this post are long overdue.

### Why now

One of my passion is home automation. This domain has changed a lot these past years, largely due to the opening of communication protocols (x10, zwave, 433MHz) and the emergence of small hacking platforms like Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and Beagle Boards.

I've bought a Raspberry Pi when it was annouced. Like many of my other geeky stuff, I've turned it on for a day or two, and then it has collected dust in a drawer.
